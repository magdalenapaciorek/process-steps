# Process Steps Block

A custom WordPress block for presenting process steps. The parent block uses InnerBlocks and block context. You can define shared styles at the parent level and have them applied to each step. Each inner block (a single step) automatically tracks its position within the parent (with useSelect) and updates its step number when reordered, ensuring the sequence always reflects the current layout.
